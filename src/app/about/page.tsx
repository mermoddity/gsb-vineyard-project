            <p>
              We envision creating a unique community of Stanford GSB alumni centered around a 
              beautiful vineyard and olive grove property in Provence, France. This isn&apos;t just 
              about owning a piece of landâ€”it&apos;s about building a legacy, fostering connections, 
              and sharing extraordinary experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to acquire and develop a property that will serve as both a productive 
              agricultural venture and a gathering place for our community. Members will have the 
              opportunity to participate in harvests, learn about wine-making and olive cultivation, 
              and enjoy the fruits of our collective labor.

          <div className="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-dark/80">
            <p>
              Once we&apos;ve established our core community and secured the property, we&apos;ll focus on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developing sustainable agricultural practices for both the vineyard and olive grove</li>
              <li>Creating comfortable accommodations for community members</li>
              <li>Organizing regular events and gatherings throughout the year</li>
              <li>Building partnerships with local vintners and agricultural experts</li>
              <li>Establishing our own wine and olive oil production facilities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The property will evolve based on our community&apos;s interests and needs, always 
              maintaining its core purpose as a place for connection, learning, and enjoyment.

            <p>
              We&apos;re currently developing a detailed financial model that will balance 
              accessibility with sustainability. The structure will likely involve:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Initial membership contributions to fund the property acquisition</li>
              <li>Annual dues to cover operational costs and improvements</li>
              <li>Optional participation in special projects or expansions</li>
              <li>Revenue sharing from wine and olive oil production</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Our focus is on creating a model that makes this unique opportunity accessible to 
              as many GSB alumni as possible while ensuring the project&apos;s long-term viability. 
              Detailed financial projections and membership options will be shared as we move forward.
